            <h1>About Eman</h1>
            <p class="zip">Something about me is that I really like to travel and experience new things. One of those things consists of Ziplining, in which I really enjoy doing! I'm a fun, outgoing, loud, and energetic person who just wants to live her life to the absolute fullest! I also recently developed a new hobby to do which is reading books! An author I really enjoy reading is Colleen Hoover! I also enjoy going to the gym as well as listening to music. And I love to spend time with my family! I want to be an inspiration to people one day who are having tough times in their lives and I want people to know that you shouldn't take life so seriously and to just live it while your young. As a high school senior, I have faced many obstacles in life, including getting through pre-calculus, but hey, I got through it and i'm still on a role!
